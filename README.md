## What is QCubed?

QCubed (pronounced 'Q' - cubed) is a PHP5 Model-View-Controller framework. The goal of the framework is to save development time around mundane, repetitive tasks - allowing you to concentrate on things that are useful AND fun.


## What is QCubed Improved

QCubed Improved is a fork of QCubed, that makes QCubed powerful and even more addictive. Some of the special features of this fork are:

### URL Rewriting

Awesome SEO friendly URLs, like www.example.com/blog/first-post or www.example.com/client/21

### Clean controllers and views

Inspired from CodeIgniter PHP framework, the logic of the program is kept in /controllers and the design in /views. Really clean structure of project.

### Basic Template

We have provided a simple Bootstrap template so you can get started quickly and also make your project look great from start.
